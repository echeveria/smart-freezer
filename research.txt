I buy chinese weighing scales model SF-400A.
1. After start it need time to go to 0 data. 
1.1 It needed display or something eles to see, when data is 0.
1.2 Need start/restart button.
2. If have a something else on a board before 0 data the weight data is wrong.
2.1 The model needed 5-6 second for prepare himself for work.
(if not display, sound seems like ok)
